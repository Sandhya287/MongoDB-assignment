    "MongoDB is an open-source, document-oriented database which is part of the NoSQL database systems. Unlike relational databases that use tables with fixed rows and columns, MongoDB is built on a non-relational, document-based model. In MongoDB, data is stored in flexible documents with a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)-like format, allowing fields to vary from document to document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are designed to handle large volumes of data that do not fit into traditional relational models. They are known for their ability to manage unstructured and semi-structured data, horizontal scaling, and flexible schema design.\n",

    "Scenarios to Use MongoDB Over SQL Databases:\n",

    "Handling Large Volumes of Unstructured Data: MongoDB is ideal for applications with large amounts of diverse data that doesn't fit well into the rigid structure of relational databases.\n",

    "Scalability Needs: MongoDB's horizontal scalability is a better fit for applications expecting large-scale growth.\n",
